question: "Do you have a Code of Conduct?"
---

Yes, we do. We have a comprehensive Code of Conduct that all attendees, speakers, sponsors, and volunteers at our conference are required to agree with and follow.

You can find our full Code of Conduct [here](https://example.com/code-of-conduct).

We are committed to providing a harassment-free and inclusive conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices.

Any breach of the Code of Conduct will be taken seriously and may result in being asked to leave the conference. If you experience or witness any behavior that violates our Code of Conduct, please report it immediately to a member of the conference staff or contact us at conduct@techconference.com.
